1. get the product list from database
2. display product list on the products page
2. get order information from database
3. display order information on the orders page.

Orders React file:
1. On selection of checkbox the confirm shipment should be enabled
2. Out of all the checkbox it should be  a single select, more than one should not be possible at this time. 

Now what't the problem happening is on refreshing the page the orders which are created are going as when I am clicking on the product and the expected behavior is once the orders are created with refresh they should not go.
How to achieve this:
1. 

1. Need to add quantity with each added product and need to display the quantity with each product, providing user the stepper with which they can increase or decrease the quantity
- After adding the product, the quantity stepper is displayed by which user can maintatin the quantity
How to achieve this:
1. copying the stepper code from my store and utilising it in orders page.js
const [quantities, setQuantities] = useState(
    products.reduce((acc, product) => {
      acc[product.id] = 1; // Default quantity is 1 for each product
      return acc;
    }, {})
  );

  // Function to handle quantity increment
  const handleIncrement = (id) => {
    setQuantities((prev) => ({
      ...prev,
      [id]: prev[id] + 1,
    }));
  };

  // Function to handle quantity decrement
  const handleDecrement = (id) => {
    setQuantities((prev) => ({
      ...prev,
      [id]: prev[id] > 0 ? prev[id] - 1 : 0, // Minimum quantity is 1
    }));
  };

  {/* Stepper */}
                <div className="flex items-center">
                  <button
                    className="btn btn-sm btn-outline"
                    onClick={() => handleDecrement(product.id)}
                  >
                    -
                  </button>
                  <span mt-2 className="mx-2">
                    {quantities[product.id]}
                  </span>
                  <button
                    className="btn btn-sm btn-outline"
                    onClick={() => handleIncrement(product.id)}
                  >
                    +
                  </button>
                </div>

Now the task is: 
1. when I create an order and when the order card is created it should come in the new section of the page, but when I send it for confirm shipment then it should go in the history tab of the page. 
How to achieve this?

- on clicking confirm shipment, putting the status as shipped and writing that in history section.

task:
1. In the history section, checkbox, confirm shipment and cancel button are not required.

What are the steps:
- 
2. There should be a border below the active tab
